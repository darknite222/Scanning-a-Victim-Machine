<h1>Scanning a Victim Machine</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
I conducted a comprehensive vulnerability scan on a target machine in this project to identify potential security weaknesses. I assessed the system using OpenVas, a vulnerability tool used for outdated software, misconfigurations, and exposed services that attackers could exploit. The scan provided valuable insights into the vulnerabilities present, enabling the formulation of effective remediation strategies to strengthen the machine's security posture.

Scan Results Review: <br/>
 
Based on the scan results, the next step would involve remediating the vulnerabilities discovered which may or may not include the following:

* Apply patches to outdated software 
* Close unnecessary open ports
* Modify misconfigurations in the system
* After remediating the vulnerabilities, you can re-scan the target machine to ensure that the vulnerabilities have been addressed
